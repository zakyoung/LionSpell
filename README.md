# LionSpell

In this assignment you will construct SwiftUI Views for a simple application based on the New
York Times Spelling Bee game. It requires a little bit of coding, but the primary goal of the
assignment is to familiarize you with the tools weâ€™ll be using in the class. Take time to explore
Xcode as this is a good investment of your time.
Your app will eventually have the following functionality: The app presents the user with 5
buttons, each displaying a different letter. The user creates words by tapping buttons to spell
out words. As the user taps, the word being formed is displayed. When a legal word is formed,
a button will be enabled that allows the user to submit the word. Each correct word scores
points and the current total score is always displayed. Legal words are at least four letters long,
with all characters drawn from the letters on the buttons. Repeated letters in a word are
allowed. The word must also be found in a list of words that will be provided. A running list of
words found by the user will be displayed. A delete button will allow the user to delete the last
letter entered. A button will allow the user to start a new game by generating a new set of letters
and another button will rearrange the letters.

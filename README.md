# LionSpell

This app is inspired by the New York Times Spelling Bee game and is developed using SwiftUI.

The app features a simple interface with five buttons, each labeled with a different letter. Users create words by tapping these buttons, with each tap adding a letter to the word currently being formed, which is displayed on the screen. Once a valid word is completed—defined as being at least four letters long and composed only of the letters displayed on the buttons—it can be submitted for points by enabling a specific button. 

Points are accumulated with each correct word, and the user's total score is displayed continuously. Users can also see a running list of all words they have successfully formed. If a user needs to correct a mistake, a delete button allows them to remove the last letter they entered. Additional functionality includes a button to start a new game, which generates a new set of letters, and another button that rearranges the existing letters to help spark new word ideas.
